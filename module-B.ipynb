First, using a funciton is prudent because it can be applied to the list of books even if the list is modified, or it could easily be applied to another set of books; just put the name of that list as an argument. Secondly, one can pull up multiple lists of books by minimum ratings count at a time without typing (or copying/pasting) the code again and again.\n",

To get a 'Top 10' or 'Top 100' books list, one would want a balanced level of reviews. What is a balanced number? Below, I calculated the mean number of rating counts, to get a frame of reference:"
